# ⚽ When Football meets Data  
Our project explores the intersection of European football and data visualization. Using historical match data and transfer records, we’ve built an interactive platform that allows users to explore how clubs perform, spend, and evolve over time.  
📊 This website presents a data-driven exploration of professional European football from 2008 to 2016. Our interactive website visualizes team performances, transfer patterns, and financial dynamics using geospatial and temporal data.
