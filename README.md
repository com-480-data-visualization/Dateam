# When Football meets Data
Our project explores the intersection of European football and data visualization. Using historical match data and transfer records, we’ve built an interactive platform that allows users to explore how clubs perform, spend, and evolve over time.
This website presents a data-driven exploration of professional European football from 2008 to 2016. Our interactive website visualizes team performances, transfer patterns, and financial dynamics using geospatial and temporal data.

## Who is This Website For?
This website is designed for a wide audience:
- **Football enthusiasts** interested in exploring how their favorite clubs evolved.
- **Analysts and scouts** seeking patterns in transfer spending and squad development.
- **Researchers and students** studying the intersection of sports, economics, and data visualization.
